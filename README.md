
Welcome, this is a repo to host a website using Python, JavaScript, HTML, Flask, Docker, Heroku.

## Hosted on the Web
* This application is hosted on the web using Heroku. Follow the Heroku-Flask link in the Supporting References section to create one for yourself.
* My page can be found at [www.michaelthamm.com](http://www.michaelthamm.com) which uses some of the Youtube videos to set up a paid custom domain or you can do it free using the herokuapp.com domain.

## Hosted Locally
* To run the web page locally, run [run-docker.sh](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/website/blob/main/run-docker.sh).

## CI/CD Automation
To test the CI/CD for the website, check out this [deployment-testing-repo](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/gitlab-docker-ci)

# Conclusion
Flask was used to create a web application using the HTML/JavaScript templates from w3schools which serve as good portfolio websites. The use of Docker and Git streamlines the maintainance process for the web application environment making it a robust workflow.
